 Two, three, four. Meet me in the hallway. Meet me in the hallway. I just left your bedroom. Give me some morphine. Is there any more to do?. Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door. Hoping you'll come around. Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor. Maybe we'll work it out. I gotta get better, gotta get better. I gotta get better, gotta get better. I gotta get better, gotta get better. And maybe we'll work it out. I walked the streets all day. Running with the thieves. 'Cause you left me in the hallway. Give me some more. Just take the pain away. Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door. Hoping you'll come around. Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor. Maybe we'll work it out. Gotta get better, gotta get better. Gotta get better, gotta get better. Gotta get better, gotta get better. And maybe we'll work it out. We don't talk about it. It's something we don't do. 'Cause once you go without it. Nothing else will do. 
 Just stop your crying. It's a sign of the times. Welcome to the final show. Hope you're wearing your best clothes. You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky. You look pretty good down here. But you ain't really good. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. The bullets, the bullets?. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. Your bullets, the bullets?. Just stop your crying. It's a sign of the times. We gotta get away from here. We gotta get away from here. Just stop your crying. It'll be alright. They told me that the end is near. We gotta get away from here. Just stop your crying. Have the time of your life. Breaking through the atmosphere. And things are pretty good from here. Remember, everything will be alright. We can meet again somewhere. Somewhere far away from here. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. The bullets, the bullets?. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. The bullets, the bullets?. Just stop your crying. It's a sign of the times. We gotta get away from here. We gotta get away from here. Stop your crying. Baby, it'll be alright. They told me that the end is near. We gotta get away from here. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. The bullets, the bullets?. We never learn, we've been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from. Your bullets, the bullets?. We don't talk enough. We should open up. Before it's all too much. Will we ever learn?. We've been here before. It's just what we know. Stop your crying, baby. It's a sign of the times. We gotta get away. We got to get away. We got to get away. We got to get away. We got to get away. We got to—we got to—away. We got to—we got to—away. We got to—we got to—away. 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. She's got a family in Carolina. So far away, but she says I remind her of home. Feeling oh so far from home. She never saw herself as a west coaster. Moved all the way cause her grandma told her. "Townes, better swim before you drown". She's a good girl. She's such a good girl. She's a good girl. She feels so good. She's got a book for every situation. Gets into parties without invitations. How could you ever turn her down?. There's not a drink that I think could sink her. How would I tell her that she's all I think about?. Well, I guess she just found out. She's a good girl. She's such a good girl. She's a good girl. She feels so good. She feels so good. I met her once and wrote a song about her. I wanna scream, yeah. I wanna shout it out. And I hope she hears me now. La la la la, la la la la la la. La la la la, la la la la la la. La la la la, la la la la la la. La la la la, la la la la la la. She's a good girl. She's such a good girl. She's a good girl. Feels so good. She feels so good. She feels so good. She feels so good. Oh, she's a good girl. She feels so good. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
 Same lips red, same eyes blue. Same white shirt, couple more tattoos. But it's not you and it's not me. Tastes so sweet, looks so real. Sounds like something that I used to feel. But I can't touch what I see. We're not who we used to be. We're not who we used to be. We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me. Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat. The fridge light washes this room white. Moon dances over your good side. This was all we used to need. Tongue-tied like we've never known. Telling those stories we already told. 'Cause we don't say what we really mean. We're not who we used to be. We're not who we used to be. We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me. We're not who we used to be. We're not who we used to be. We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty. Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat. We're not who we used to be. We're not who we used to be. We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me. We're not who we used to be. We don't see what we used to see. We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty. Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat. Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat. I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat. 
 Sweet creature. Had another talk about where it's going wrong. But we're still young. We don't know where we're going but we know where we belong. And ohhhh, we started. Two hearts in one home. It's hard when we argue. We're both stubborn, I know. But oh. Sweet creature, sweet creature. Wherever I go, you bring me home. Sweet creature, sweet creature. When I run out of road, you bring me home. Sweet creature. Running through the garden, oh, where nothing bothered us. But we're still young. I always think about you and how we don't speak enough. And ohhhh, we started. Two hearts in one home. I know it's hard, we argue. We're both stubborn, I know. But oh. Sweet creature, sweet creature. Wherever I go, you bring me home. Sweet creature, sweet creature. When I run out of road, you bring me home. And ohhh, when we started. Just two hearts in one home. It gets harder when we argue. We're both stubborn, I know. But oh. Sweet creature, sweet creature. Wherever I go, you bring me home. Sweet creature, sweet creature. When I run out of road, you bring me home. You bring me home. 
 I saw this angel. I really saw an angel. Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see. That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me. I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth. And there's nothing I can do about it. Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door. I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor. Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short. But I think that's what I like about it. She's an angel. Only angel. She's an angel. My only angel. I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine. As I went about my business through the warning signs. End up meeting in the hallway every single time. And there's nothing we can do about it. Told it to her brother and she told it to me. That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see. When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets. And there's nothing she can do about it. Hey, hey. She's an angel. Only angel. She's an angel. My only angel. She's an angel. Only angel. She's an angel. My only angel. Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight. Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight. Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight. She's an angel. Only angel. She's an angel. My only angel. She's an angel. My only angel. She's an angel. My-my-my-my only angel. 
 She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes. Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect. And all the boys, they were saying they were into it. Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck. She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it. I'm kind of into it. It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it. Oh, I think she said, "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business. I'm having your baby, it's none of your business (it's none of your, it's none of your). I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business. I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your, it's none of your". It's New York, baby, always jacked up. Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up. When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus. In a black dress, she's such an actress. Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it. I'm kind of into it. It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it. Oh, I think she said, "I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business. I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business (it's none of your, it's none of your). I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business. I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your, it's none of your". She sits beside me like a silhouette. Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet. And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it. It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this. It's none of your, it's none of your. "I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business". "I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your). "I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business". "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your). 
 Tell me something, tell me something. You don't know nothing, just pretend you do. I need something, tell me something new. Choose your words 'cause there's no antidote. For this curse. Oh, what's it waiting for?. Must this hurt you just before you go?. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news. There's no water inside this swimming pool. Almost over, had enough from you. And I've been praying, I never did before. Understand I'm talking to the walls. I've been praying ever since New York. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Tell me something, tell me something. You don't know nothing, just pretend you do. Tell me something just before you go. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. Oh, tell me something I don't already know. 
 Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?. (la la la la la la la). I'm selfish, I know. But I don't ever want to see you with him. I'm selfish, I know. I told you, but I know you never listen. I hope you can see, the shape that I'm in. While he's touching your skin. He's right where I should, where I should be. But you're making me bleed. Woman. Woman (la la la la la la la). W-woman. Woman. Woman. Woman (la la la la la la la). W-woman. Woman. Tempted, you know. Apologies are never gonna fix this. I'm empty, I know. Promises are broken like a stitch is. I hope you can see, the shape I've been in. While he's touching your skin. This thing upon me, howls like a beast. You flower, you feast. Woman. Woman (la la la la la la la). W-woman. Woman. Woman. Woman (la la la la la la la). W-woman. Woman. Woman!. 
 Woke up alone in this hotel room. Played with myself, where were you?. Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon. I've never felt less cool. We haven't spoke since you went away. Comfortable silence is so overrated. Why won't you ever be the first one to break?. Even my phone misses your call, by the way. I saw your friend that you know from work. He said you feel just fine. I see you gave him my old t-shirt. More of what was once mine. I see it's written, it's all over his face. Comfortable silence is so overrated. Why won't you ever say what you want to say?. Even my phone misses your call, by the way. Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too. Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too. Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too. But you, you never do. Woke up the girl who looked just like you. I almost said your name. We haven't spoke since you went away. Comfortable silence is so overrated. Why won't you ever say what you want to say?. Even my phone misses your call. We haven't spoke since you went away. Comfortable silence is so overrated. Why won't you ever say what you want to say?. Even my phone misses your call, by the way. 
 Golden, golden, golden. As I open my eyes. Hold it, focus, hoping. Take me back to the light. I know you were way too bright for me. I'm hopeless, broken. So you wait for me in the sky. Browns my skin just right. You're so golden. You're so golden. I'm out of my head. And I know that you're scared. Because hearts get broken. I don't wanna be alone. I don't wanna be alone. When it ends. Don't wanna let you know. I don't wanna be alone. But I, I can feel it take a hold. I can feel you take control. Of who I am and all I've ever known. Loving you's the antidote. Golden. You're so golden. I don't wanna be alone. You're so golden. You're so golden. I'm out of my head. And I know that you're scared. Because hearts get broken. (Golden, golden, golden, golden). (Golden, golden, golden, golden). (Golden, golden, golden, golden). (Golden, golden, golden, golden). (Golden, golden, golden, golden). (Golden, golden, golden, golden). I know that you're scared. Because I'm so open. You're so golden. I don't wanna be alone. You're so golden. You're so golden. You're so golden. I'm out of my head. And I know that you're scared. Because hearts get broken. 
 Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'. And it sounds just like a song. I want more berries and that summer feelin'. It's so wonderful and warm. Breathe me in, breathe me out. I don't know if I could ever go without. I'm just thinking out loud. I don't know if I could ever go without. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar. Strawberries on a summer evenin'. Baby, you're the end of June. I want your belly and that summer feelin'. Getting washed away in you.

Watermelon sugar high (Sugar). Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar high. I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Woo). Watermelon sugar high. I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh). Watermelon sugar high. Watermelon sugar. 
 Walk in your rainbow paradise. Strawberry lipstick state of mind. I get so lost inside your eyes. Would you believe it?. You don't have to say you love me. You don't have to say nothing. You don't have to say you're mine. Honey. I'd walk through fire for you. Just let me adore you. Oh honey. I'd walk through fire for you. Just let me adore you. Like it's the only thing I'll ever do. Like it's the only thing I'll ever do. You're wonder, under summer skies. Brown skin and lemon over ice. Would you believe it?. You don't have to say you love me. I just wanna tell you something. Lately you've been on my mind. Honey. I'd walk through fire for you. Just let me adore you. Oh honey. I'd walk through fire for you. Just let me adore you. Like it's the only thing I'll ever do. Like it's the only thing I'll ever do. (It's the only thing I'll ever do). (It's the only thing I'll ever do). (It's the only thing I'll ever do). (It's the only thing I'll ever do).

I'd walk through fire for you. Just let me adore you. Oh honey. Just let me adore you. Like it's the only thing I'll ever do. 
 What do you mean?. I'm sorry by the way. I'm never coming back down. Can't you see. I could but wouldn't stay?. I wouldn't put it like that. What do you mean?. I'm sorry by the way. I'm never coming around. It'd be so sweet if. Things just stayed the same. La-da-da-da-da. All the lights couldn't put out the dark. Running through my heart. Lights up and they know who you are. Know who you are. Do you know who you are?. (Shine). Step into the light (Shine). So bright sometimes (Shine). I'm not ever going back. (Shine). Step into the light (Shine). So bright sometimes (Shine). I'm not ever going back. (Shine). Step into the light (Shine). So bright sometimes (Shine). I'm not ever. What do you mean?. I'm sorry by the way.

Running through my heart. Lights up and they know who you are. Know who you are. Do you know who you are?. 
 Don't you call him 'baby'. We're not talking lately. Don't you call him what you used to call me. I, I confess. I can tell that you are at your best. I'm selfish so I'm hating it. I noticed that. There's a piece of you in how I dress. Take it as a compliment. Don't you call him 'baby'. We're not talking lately. Don't you call him what you used to call me. I, I just miss. I just miss your accent and your friends. Did you know I still talk to them?. Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?. Don't you call him 'baby'. We're not talking lately. Don't you call him what you used to call me. Don't you call him 'baby'. We're not talking lately. Don't you call him what you used to call me. Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée.... Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important.... Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—. Parfait ! Harry. 
 I'm in my bed. And you're not here. And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands. Forget what I said. It's not what I meant. And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left. What am I now?. What am I now?. What if I'm someone I don't want around?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. What if I'm down?. What if I'm out?. What if I'm someone you won't talk about?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. You said you cared. And you missed me too. And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you. And the coffee's out. At the Beachwood Cafe. And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say. What am I now?. What am I now?. What if I'm someone I don't want around?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. What if I'm down?. What if I'm out?. What if I'm someone you won't talk about?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again. What am I now?. What am I now?. What if you're someone I just want around?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. What if I'm down?. What if I'm out?. What if I'm someone you won't talk about?. I'm falling again. I'm falling again. I'm falling. 
 Don't blame me for falling. I was just a little boy. Don't blame the drunk caller. Wasn't ready for it all. You can't blame me, darling. Not even a little bit. I was away. And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch who can't admit when he's sorry. Don't call me "baby" again. You got your reasons. I know that you're tryna be friends. I know you mean it. Don't call me "baby" again. It's hard for me to go home. Be so lonely. I just hope you see me. In a little better light. Do you think it's easy. Being of the jealous kind?. 'Cause I miss the shape of your lips. You'll win. It's just a trick. And this is it, so I'm sorry. Don't call me "baby" again. You got your reasons. I know that you're tryna be friends. I know you mean it. Don't call me "baby" again. It's hard for me to go home. Be so lonely. To be so lonely. To be so. To be so lonely. To be so lonely. To be so. To be so lonely. And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch who can't admit when he's sorry. Don't call me "baby" again. You got your reasons. I know that you're tryna be friends. I know you mean it. Don't call me "baby" again. It's hard for me to go home. Be so lonely. To be so lonely. To be so. To be so lonely. To be so lonely. To be so. To be so lonely. 
 9 in the morning. The man drops his kids off at school. And he's thinking of you. Like all of us do. Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon. Around 1:32. Like he knows what to do. She. She lives in daydreams with me. She's the first one that I see. And I don't know why. I don't know who she is. He takes a boat out. Imagines just sailing away (Away, away). And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates). He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say). She. She lives in daydreams with me. She's the first one that I see. And I don't know why. I don't know who she is. She. She's the first one that I see. She lives in daydreams with me. And I don't know why. I don't know where she is. Lives for the memory. A woman who's just in his head. And she sleeps in his bed. While he plays pretend. So pretend. She. She lives in daydreams with me. She's the first one that I see. And I don't know why. I don't know who she is. She. She's the first one that I see. She lives in daydreams with me. And I don't know why. I don't know where she is. 
 Sunflower. Sunflower. My eyes. Want you more than a melody. Let me inside. Wish I could get to know you. Sunflowers. Sometimes. Keep it sweet in your memory. I was just tongue-tied. And I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to talk to you. My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower). I couldn't want you any more. Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor. I couldn't want you any more tonight. Wondering headshake. Tired eyes are the death of me. Mouth full of toothpaste. Before I got to know you. I've got your face. Hung up high in the gallery. Out of this shade (Sunflower, sunflower). Your flowers just died. Plant new seeds in the melody. Let me inside, I wanna get to know you. I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to act a fool. My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower). I couldn't want you any more. Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor. I couldn't want you any more tonight. I couldn't want you any more. Kids in the kitchen listen to dance hall. I couldn't want you any more tonight. Sunflower. My eyes. Want you more than a melody. Let me inside. Wish I could get to know you. Sunflowers just died. Keep it sweet in your memory. I'm still tongue-tied. Sunflower, sunflower. Sunflower, sunflower. Sunflower, sunflower. 
 You gotta see it to believe it. Sky never looked so blue. So hard to leave it. That's what I always do. So I keep thinking back to. A time under the canyon moon. The world's happy waiting. Doors yellow, broken, blue. I heard Jenny saying. "Go get the kids from school". And I keep thinking back to. A time under the canyon moon. I'll be gone too long from you. Staring at the ceiling. Two weeks and I'll be home. Carry the feeling. Through Paris, all through Rome. And I'm still thinking back to. A time under the canyon moon. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going home. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going home. Quick pause in conversation. She plays songs I've never heard. An old lover's hippie music. Pretends not to know the words. And I keep thinking back to. A time under the canyon moon. I'll be gone too long from you. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going home. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going home. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going. I'm going, oh I'm going home. 
 Maybe, we can find a place to feel good. And we can treat people with kindness. Find a place to feel good. I've got a good feeling. I'm just takin' it all in. Floating up and dreamin'. Droppin' into the deep end. And if we're here long enough. They'll sing a song for us (Ah-ah-ah-ah). And we'll belong. Maybe, we can find a place to feel good. And we can treat people with kindness. Find a place to feel good. Given second chances. I don't need all the answers. Feeling good in my skin. I just keep on dancin'. And if we're here long enough. We'll see it's all for us. And we'll belong. Maybe, we can find a place to feel good. And we can treat people with kindness. Find a place to feel good. And it's just another day (And it's just another day). And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh). It's okay (It's okay, it's okay). It's okay (It's okay, it's okay) Yeah. Hey!. Here we go now. Maybe, we can find a place to feel good. And we can treat people with kindness. Find a place to feel good. All we ever want is automatic all the time. All we ever want is auto all of the time. All we ever want is automatic all the time. All we ever want is auto all of the time. (All together now!). Maybe, we can (One more time!) find a place to feel good (Oh yeah!). And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness!). Find a place to feel good. 
 Put a price on emotion. I'm looking for something to buy. You've got my devotion. But man, I can hate you sometimes. I don't want to fight you. And I don't wanna sleep in the dirt. We'll get the drinks in. So I'll get to thinking of her. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. Test of my patience. There's things that we'll never know. You sunshine, you temptress. My hand's at risk, I fold. Crisp trepidation. I'll try to shake this soon. Spreading you open. Is the only way of knowing you. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be alright. We'll be alright. We'll be a fine line. We'll be a fine line. We'll be alright. We'll be alright. We'll be alright. 
 Don't know where you're laying, just know it's not with me. Don't know what I'd tell you if I passed you on the street. I don't want your sympathy. But you don't know what you do to me. Oh, Anna. Every time I see your face. There's only so much I can take. Oh, Anna. Don't know how you taste when there's smoke in your perfume. So chew me up and spit me out, nothing left to lose. I don't want your sympathy. But you don't know what you do to me. Oh, Anna. Every time I see your face. There's only so much I can take. Oh, Anna. I don't want your sympathy. But you don't know what you do to me. Oh, Anna. Every time I see your face. There's only so much I can take. Oh, Anna. Hope you never hear this and know that it's for you. I don't know what I'd tell you if you asked me for the truth. I don't want your sympathy. But you'll never know what you do to me. Oh, Anna. Every time I see your face.

 Now you were standing there right in front of me. I hold on, it's getting harder to breathe. All of a sudden these lights are blinding me. I never noticed how bright they would be. I saw in the corner there is a photograph. No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you. It lies there alone in its bed of broken glass. This bed was never made for two. I'll keep my eyes wide open. I'll keep my arms wide open. Don't let me. Don't let me. Don't let me go. 'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone. Don't let me. Don't let me go. 'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone.

 Isn't she lovely. Isn't she wonderful. Isn't she precious. Less than one minute old. I never thought through love we'd be. Making one as lovely as she. But isn't she lovely made from love.

 I took my love, I took it down. I climbed a mountain and I turned around. And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills. 'Till the landslide brought me down. Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?. Can the child within my heart rise above?. Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?. Can I handle the seasons of my life?.
